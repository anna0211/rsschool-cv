# Summary

---
In my university I studied Programming, but it gives me only Basics. Although we had a strong Data Base teacher. So I was really interesting of it. I like to constanly study something new and gain my skills.Because of that I decided to develop my coding skills.  As a result I decided to study Frontend.

Before the begining of stage 0, I tried studying free-courses on Hexlet and Stepic. It helped me to structure knowkledges. So I want to learn more and more about JS. I hope to not give up and reach the end of this course.
